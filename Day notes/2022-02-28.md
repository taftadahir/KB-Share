## Queries consolidation ( SFSTRY0006475)

### Implementation
- Only one category called *Passenger Cars Sales*
	- 13 children categories
	- *Category* > *Items*

	- [x] *Agent Demos* > *Regional Demonstrator Booking* 
		- This category exist in only one exemplaire 
		- Contains only this item if the general query one is removed
		- This item exist only in one exemplaire
	- Resume for *Agent Demos*
		- On item level, Don't find dupplicate, so nothing I can suggest
		- On category level, it will have only one item if we remove the *general query*, so maybe we can move the item in other category or add more items in here to  help delete some others category. IDK

	- *Agent Sales Support* > *Unable to Generate Invoice* + *Unable to Generate Contract*
		- This category exist in only one exemplaire
		- These items could be combine as one
			- They have the same fields
			- Same fields validations
			- Same User Criteria
			- Only difference are the name and description
				- Could be renamed as *Unable to generate Invoice/Contract*
				- Description can be rewritten
	- *Agent Sales Support* > *Funds Not Cleared on Invoice* + *Deposit Not Progressing*
		- This category exist in only one exemplaire
		- They have the same fields
			- Same fields validations
			- Same User Criteria
			- Only difference are the name and description
				- Could be renamed 
				- Description can be rewritten
	- Resume for *Agent Sales Support*
		- There are 4  items with *differents name and description*
		- Same *UC*
		- Same *fields*
		- Same *fields validation*
		- Same *category* and *parent category*
		- Same *Assignment group*
		- Why not create one query for all the 4?
			- If this is an option, then the category will contain only one query and then we could also think of removing the category as it has only one item.

	- *Certified Pre Owned (CPO)* > *Duty paid dates* + *Missing Vin number / Rego / First Rego date* + *Vehicle movement for CPO* + *Add or remove CPO warranty after carding* + *Delete or amend sales cards in UCaRs* + *Change CPO Logic to be captured as Demo / CPO*
		- This item exist only in one exemplaire
	- Resume for *Certified Pre Owned (CPO)*
		- There are  7 items minus the *General query* one = 6
		- They have *differents fields* and they seem to be all differents
		- They have the same *UC* but there is only one of the query that have a different one *Duty paid dates*
		- Same *Assignment group*
		- I don't see something we can do here to reduce the number of items but maybe there are regarding business perspective
	
	- *Fleet, VIP, Diplomatic and Agent Programme* > *Corporate Tier 2 Application* + *Request for VIP approval* + *Servicing Extensions* + *Corporate service extension*
		- Items seems differents
		- Have *different fields*
		- Differents *UC*; not all
			- Some of them have the same *UC* ( *Request for VIP approval* and *Corporate Tier 2 Application* )
			- Some of them have the same *UC* ( *Servicing Extensions*, *Fleet Programme - New Fleet Customer*, *Diplomatic Sales Programme*, *Charity Sales*, *VIP Programme*, *Fleet Programme - Company Eligibility Search* and *Corporate service extension* )
		- Different *Assignment Group*; some of them have the same *AG* ( *Corporate service extension* and *Corporate Tier 2 Application* and *Request for VIP approval* )
	- Resume for *Fleet, VIP, Diplomatic and Agent Programme*
		- I don't see anything we can do here

- *MBAuP Pricing AU* > *Invoice - Incorrect Pricing* and *Contract - Incorrect Pricing*
	- 2 items
	- Same *UC*
	- Same fields and validation
	- Same *Assignment group*
- Resume *MBAuP Pricing AU* 
	- Can be combine
		- New name proposition : *Incorrect Pricing for Invoice/Contract*
	- If combined, the group removal also can be considered if we have somewhere to put the item

- *Network Development* > *Inactive staff in GEMS* and *Invalid staff email in GEMS*
	- The category is dupplicated 3 times
	- items seems differents
	- *UC*
		- Same *uc* ( *Inactive staff in GEMS* and *Invalid staff email in GEMS* )
- Resume for *Network Development*
	- Categories can be deleted and leave just one of them
	- *Inactive staff in GEMS* and *Invalid staff email in GEMS* seem the same and the only difference I see is *Staff email* and *New staff email*. I don't know if these two items are related but ...

- *Passenger Car Ordering* > *Remove from IDR*, *Vehicle Specification Changes*, *Production Dates*, *Backorder Deletion*
	- These items seems to be all differents in business logics
	- They have difference regarding fields
	- Have the same *AG*

- *Passenger Car Stock* > *Failed Marine Inspection*, *Sales Card Reversal Request*, *Vehicle Dispatch Update*, *Sales Card Issues*, *VPC Processing*, *Vessel Update*
	- Fields are differents
		- *Vehicle Dispatch Update* and *Sales Card Reversal Request* have the same fields but I don't know if the are related on business level
