Hi Pradeep,

This can be ignored as the code violation is talking about not using current.update() in BR but we did not use it in the BR. So thgis is a false code violation.

I check this and it have one customer update on Catalog Client Script which have a DELETE action and the code Violation are saying that we need to check in the script that the form is loading and return nothing. But we deleted the Catalog Client Script, so it is also a false code violation that can be ignored.

The second code violation is also talking about checking  newValue != oldValue in the script but the catalog client script is deleted so it can also be ignored.

I think the deletion is intended but the code violation don't have a meaning here so maybe Gowri want to have a look on that tomorrow.

BR,
