### Solution design
1. Stages in RITMs are not ordered correctly
2. In PC Upgrade "for new device" must not be mandatory
3. In mobile device ML Varset update lookup label fields to show SD-model-vendor
4. In Flow Special Order the correct CATEGORY for Action "Get Assignment Group" must be set 
5. IMAC Store ML varset Mufu printer: make field printer mandatory
6. In PC Upgrade ML Varset the variable "For new Device" should be read only and shouldn't be editable until Checkbox PC or Laptop is checked 
7. In all ML Varset's for "Delivery" the default value should be 10 not Standard 
8. Flow Action "IMAC QIP AddMAC", Inputs.mac zweimal mit grossem I geschrieben, muss i sein, 'site': input. hier fehlt 's'
9. The selected devices in the ml varset are not mapped correctly in the CatItems 
10. Manual NW Task in MuFu Printer --> Condition should be inputs.nw == true 
11. In Catalog Item "Docking Station" variable "For new Device" must be removed 
12. In Flow "IMAC Services" the value for rejected must be changed from "12" to "rejected"

- [x] IMAC Store ML varset Mufu printer: make field printer mandatory

	- [x] Where these ritm are created? -> Workflow
	- [ ] It is not completed, I don't why they publish it [How to add a new item to an existing request with catalog variables](https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=b2a58feddbd8dbc01dcaf3231f96192e)
- [x] Manual NW Task in MuFu Printer --> Condition should be inputs.nw == true
