  [] After the submission of the query the input variables (catalog questions/variables) shall 
     be read only to the requestor and other persons entitled to see the submitted orders in the portal
     (the agents  are being authorized via roles due to integration, this authorization is not part of this
      story)

  [] Standard-Widget configured by Daimler Team is to be used

        - Watch list
        - Work notes list
       - Additional comments
        - Work notes
        - Activity Stream
    [] "Related Records" (OOTB available)
    [] Instead of Section "Closure Information" apply Section "Resolution Information" containing
       these fields on the Case form
        - Resolved by
        - Closed by
        - Resolved
