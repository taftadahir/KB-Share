DXC_DAHIRTFT_STRY0039102_IMAC_workflow_upgrade_pc_laptop



### Questions
I saw that the approval field is used differently in the others flows than the one I have created 'IMAC Store Services'. And I think I'm wrong here so I need to update it. 
So I don't know, how do I proceed? Do I update it in the update set I am working on or is there another solution???


The problem to explain, I compare the result of 'IMAC APproval' with some value but today when I was looking for that in others stories, it was not the same as what I have used. So I investigate it and find out that I was wrong or it may be changed by the time. So need to adapt it to the new value.
