### Design
[] Create Categories for the Australian Market with parent child relationship according the 
    "Category Hierarchy Tree" on the tab Hierarchy (column B "Level 2" is the parent category, 
    column C "Level 3" is the sub category", column A "Level 1" can be ignored re. to be seen 
    as Overseas Australia scope)
[] and restrict "Available for" to the user criteria 
    "OVERSEAS DISPONENT" (as a temporary measure - when GEMS roles are available 
    restrict to AU/NZ countries re. Australian market)

### Solution Design
[] Create a record producer under the application scope "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management Overseas" [x_4dai_omgt_mbos]
  [] For table [x_4dai_omgt_mbos_au_case] 
  [] Name:  "Corporate service extension"
  [] Short description: 
      Request to extend corporate servicing due to extreme circumstances
  [] Description: 
      Request to extend corporate servicing due to extreme circumstances
  [] Apply the already existing variable set: "Generic OMGT-Overseas Case Variables" 
      (see Generic OMGT-MY Case Variables) with 
      these variables and the catalog UI policy "Contact Read-only"
      - Account
      - Contact
  [] Create the further questions/variables shown in the mock-up attachment of the story 
  [] Apply validations as being described in the comments of the fields in the mock-up 
  [] Apply the already existing variable set: "OMGT-Overseas Additional details"

  [] Use the picture attached to the story for the icon and picture of the record producer 
      (will be covered in a later story when pictures are available)

  [] After the submission of the query the input variables (catalog questions/variables) shall 
     be read only to the requestor and other persons entitled to see the submitted orders in the portal
     (the agents  are being authorized via roles due to integration, this authorization is not part of this
      story)

  [] Standard-Widget configured by Daimler Team is to be used
  [] Put the catalog item/record producer under the sub category " Corporate and Fleet" 
  [] Catalog: Customer Service
  [] Available For: link to user criteria  "ORDERMGMT-OVERSEAS_DISPONENT_Australia"

[] Configure the layout for the standard UI Case form:
  [] Apply the mandatory fields as defined in the mockup 
  [] Show these header fields on the case form
    [] Left column
       - Number
       - Account  (ootb field and mandatory)
       - Contact
    [] Right column
       - Needs attention (flag)
       - State
       - Opened
       - Opened by
       - Priority
       - Assignment Group
       - Assigned to
    [] Below these two columns
       - Short description (full row, this field shall contain the Query name)
    [] Put a separation line between the header Case fields and the below fields
    [] Add further fields below the separation line (mandatory or optional according the mockup comments)
        - VIN Number
       - Commission Number
       - Reason for extension
       - Is the vehicle past its 90 grace period
       - Customer Name
       - Vehicule KMs
       - Additional Details
  [] Show these related lists (in the given order)
     [] "Notes" containing
        - Watch list
        - Work notes list
       - Additional comments
        - Work notes
        - Activity Stream
    [] "Related Records" (OOTB available)
    [] Instead of Section "Closure Information" apply Section "Resolution Information" containing
       these fields on the Case form
        - Resolved by
        - Closed by
        - Resolved
        - Closed
        - Resolution code
        - Resolution notes
    [] "Request Details" containing the read only variables from the original record producer request
        (see above)

[]  Assignment rule handling for the above record producer -  this is being handled separately
