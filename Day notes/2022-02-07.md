  [] Available For: link to user criteria with the name containing the text after "Alice Job Title:" in the below Job Title descriptions:
- Alice Job Title: New Vehicle Sales Manager MB Cars -> Australia - Dealer - New Vehicle Sales Manager Cars 
- Alice Job Title: Corporate Sales Manager MB Cars AU -> Australia - Dealer - Corporate Sales Manager Cars

    After the submission of the query the input variables (catalog questions/variables) shall 
     be read only to the requestor and other persons entitled to see the submitted orders in the portal
     (the agents  are being authorized via roles due to integration, this authorization is not part of this
      story)
[] Create UI View for the Query
[] Create View Rule for the Query
[] Create Forms/Form layout for the query:

 Configure the layout for the standard UI Case form:
 Apply the mandatory fields as defined in the mockup 
 Show these header fields on the case form
Left column
       - Number
       - Account  (ootb field and mandatory)
       - Contact
Right column
       - Needs attention (flag)
       - State
       - Opened
       - Opened by
       - Priority
       - Assignment Group
       - Assigned to
 Below these two columns
       - Short description (full row, this field shall contain the Query name)
   
    [] Put a separation line between the header Case fields and the below fields
    [] Add further fields below the separation line (mandatory or optional according the comments in the spreadsheet attached to the story)

 Show these related lists (in the given order)
[] "Notes" containing
        - Watch list
        - Work notes list
       - Additional comments
        - Work notes
        - Activity Stream

[] Instead of Section "Closure Information" apply Section "Resolution Information" containing
       these fields on the Case form
        - Resolved by
        - Closed by
        - Resolved
        - Closed
        - Resolution code
        - Resolution notes

 [] "Request Details" containing the read only variables from the original record producer request
-	Form section "Request Details" is visible only if the case has been created by Dealer re. via the User from the b2b portal else it should be NOT visible

[] Add the Query above into the Interceptor "Dealer Query (Australia)"

//ASSIGNMENT //
[]  Assignment rule handling for the above record producer 
- Assign after creation automatically to group:   "MBAuP Pricing AU" 
If the above group does not exist, create the group with:
  - Group members as mentioned in column 'Fulfiller functional department' in the attached spreadsheet
  - Group Manager as mentioned in column 'Escalation Logic/ Process' in the attached spreadsheet
  - Assign the Assignment Group to the CSM Domain 'omgt_au' (Order Management Australia)
  - Include the users also in the update set for deployment to further instances (This step is applicable only for the Fulfilment Groups) – as per discussion with Leonid and Pradeep on 27.01.2022


// PRIORITY / URGENCY/ SLA // 
[] Data lookup rule:
Create new rule in x_4dai_omgt_mbos_dealer_query_overseas_lookup_rules
- Query type: the same as the query name
- Priority : 3-Moderate (due to [CR] INC INC0524720)
- Urgency: 2-Medium
