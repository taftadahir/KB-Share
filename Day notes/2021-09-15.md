### Solution Design
----------------------------------------
[] Create a record producer under the application scope "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management  
    Overseas" [x_4dai_omgt_mbos]
  [] For table [x_4dai_omgt_mbos_au_case] 
  [] Name:  "Insurance related enquiry"
  [] Short description: 
      General query related to Insurance
  [] Description: 
     General query related to Insurance

      Note: must include two photos - one close up from 15-30cm away, one distance from 1m away
  [] Owner: "Khaylov, Leonid"

  [] Apply the already existing variable set: "Generic OMGT-Overseas Case Variables" 
      (see Generic OMGT-MY Case Variables) with 
      these variables and the catalog UI policy "Contact Read-only"
      - Account
      - Contact
  [] Create the further questions/variables shown in the mock-up attachment of the story 
  [] Apply the already existing variable set: "OMGT-Overseas Additional details"
  [] Apply validations as being described in the comments of the fields in the mock-up 

  [] Use the picture attached to the story for the icon and picture of the record producer 
      (will be covered in a later story when pictures are available)

  [] After the submission of the query the input variables (catalog questions/variables) shall 
     be read only to the requestor and other persons entitled to see the submitted orders in the portal
     (the agents  are being authorized via roles due to integration, this authorization is not part of this
      story)

  [] Standard-Widget configured by Daimler Team is to be used
  [] Put the catalog item/record producer under the sub category "Autobody" 
  [] Catalog:  Customer Service
  [] Available For: link to user criteria  "ORDERMGMT-OVERSEAS_DISPONENT_Australia"

[] Configure the layout for the standard UI Case form:
  [] Apply the mandatory fields as defined in the mockup 
  [] Show these header fields on the case form
    [] Left column
       - Number
       - Account  (ootb field and mandatory)
       - Contact
    [] Right column
       - Needs attention (flag)
       - State
       - Opened
       - Opened by
       - Priority
       - Assignment Group
       - Assigned to
    [] Below these two columns
       - Short description (full row, this field shall contain the Query name)
    [] Put a separation line between the header Case fields and the below fields
  [] Show these related lists (in the given order)
     [] "Notes" containing
        - Watch list
        - Work notes list
       - Additional comments
        - Work notes
        - Activity Stream
    [] "Related Records" (OOTB available)
    [] Instead of Section "Closure Information" apply Section "Resolution Information" containing
       these fields on the Case form
        - Resolved by
        - Closed by
        - Resolved
        - Closed
        - Resolution code
        - Resolution notes
    [] "Request Details" containing the read only variables from the original record producer request

# Schaeffler (1h30)

Hi Yelda,
Good morning

In the flow, I need to check if the request is rejected and the imac approval return the approval state. So I dig into into the table to find the value using the table sc_req_item and there are a lot of choices but only one is called approval rejected with value 12. 
So you need to check if is the right choice?

IMAC Get Assignment Group
It has category and location inputs. Do I leave them empty(they are not required)?
And I also don't know if the action will do what it is supposed to do, there is no gr.query() before the if.

Provider Integration : Subflow not yet available

IMAC Get AuthCode: I thing it is not finished also, cause the input here is authcode_orderinfo, instead of req_item_sys_id. So I can not pass the req_item sys_id. (Need validation if I undertood it well)
