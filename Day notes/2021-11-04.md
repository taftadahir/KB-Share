### Solution design
[] Extend  the following menu items which are in the related list of the menu item "My Lists"
    (which is in the instance with Menu "CSM Header Menu")
    to be found here: https://dev4mb.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsp_rectangle_menu_item.do%3Fsys_id%3Dddf555601bd030107aeaca616b4bcb93%26sysparm_record_target%3Dsp_rectangle_menu_item%26sysparm_record_row%3D3%26sysparm_record_rows%3D11%26sysparm_record_list%3Dsp_rectangle_menu%253Db0928873cb53020000f8d856634c9cb0%255EORDERBYorder

- All Cases - Dealer Queries
- My Cases - Dealer Queries
- Need Attention - Dealer Queries

These are containing the condition "AliceDM.hasCurrentUserAliceRole('ORDERMGMT-OVERSEAS_DISPONENT')"
which needs to be extended to
"AliceDM.hasCurrentUserAliceRole('ORDERMGMT-OVERSEAS_DISPONENT') OR
AliceDM.hasCurrentUserAliceRole('ORDERMGMT-OVERSEAS_DISPONENT_ALL-ORGS')"

### Implementation

- [x] Updated condition for menu items
	- [x] My Cases - Dealer Queries
	- [x] All Cases - Dealer Queries
	- [x] Need Attention - Dealer Queries
