**Solution Design**

---------------------

// RECORD PRODUCER: //

[] Create a record producer under the application scope "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management 

 Overseas" [x_4dai_omgt_mbos]

 [] For table [x_4dai_omgt_mbos_au_case]

 [] Name: " Fleet Programme - Company Eligibility Search"

 [] Short description: see Description column of the spreadsheet attached to the story

 [] Description: the same as Short description

 [] Owner: "Leonid Khaylov"

 [] Apply the already existing variable set: "Generic OMGT-AU Case Variables"

 and the catalog UI policy "Contact Read-only"

 [] Add the UI Policies to make the fields indicated in the Variable column visible and mandatory

 [] Apply the already existing variable set: Variable Set: “OMGT-Overseas Additional details”

 [] Leave “Additional Details” question not mandatory

 [] Use the picture attached to the story for the icon and picture of the record producer (can be skipped for the time being - will be delivered later on)

 [] Catalog: Customer Service

 [] Available For: link to user criteria with the name containing the text after “Alice Job Title:” in the below Job Title descriptions:

· Alice Job Title: New Vehicle Sales Manager Cars

· Alice Job Title: Corporate Sales Manager Cars (under clarification)

· Alice Job Title: New Vehicle Sales Consultant Cars

· Alice Job Title: Service Manager Cars

//CATEGORY//

[] Create the below new category(ies) (if it hasn't been done in another Story already):

 [] Name: “Fleet, VIP, Diplomatic and Agent Programme” with these attributes

 [] Catalog: “Customer Service”

 [] Parent: “Passenger Cars Sales”

 [] Available for:

[OVERSEAS DISPONENT](https://dev4mb.service-now.com/user_criteria.do?sys_id=3f4cdc5e1bbf20107aeaca616b4bcb62&sysparm_view=item)

 [] Put the catalog item/record producer under the just being created category

 (otherwise we write: Put the catalog item/record producer under sub category shown in the

 spreadsheet attached to the story) – please remove

------------------------------------

// TABLE/VIEW CORRECTIONS - x_4dai_omgt_mbos_au_case //

 After the submission of the query the input variables (catalog questions/variables) shall

 be read only to the requestor and other persons entitled to see the submitted orders in the portal

 (the agents are being authorized via roles due to integration, this authorization is not part of this

 story)

[] Create UI View for the Query

[] Create View Rule for the Query

[] Create Forms/Form layout for the query:

 Configure the layout for the standard UI Case form:

 Apply the mandatory fields as defined in the mockup

 Show these header fields on the case form

Left column

 - Number

 - Account (ootb field and mandatory)

 - Contact

Right column

 - Needs attention (flag)

 - State

 - Opened

 - Opened by

 - Priority

 - Assignment Group

 - Assigned to

 Below these two columns

 - Short description (full row, this field shall contain the Query name)

 [] Put a separation line between the header Case fields and the below fields

 [] Add further fields below the separation line (mandatory or optional according the comments in the spreadsheet attached to the story)

 Show these related lists (in the given order)

[] "Notes" containing

 - Watch list

 - Work notes list

 - Additional comments

 - Work notes

 - Activity Stream

[] Instead of Section "Closure Information" apply Section "Resolution Information" containing

 these fields on the Case form

 - Resolved by

 - Closed by

 - Resolved

 - Closed

 - Resolution code

 - Resolution notes

 [] "Request Details" containing the read only variables from the original record producer request

- Form section "Request Details" is visible **only** if the case has been created by Dealer re. via the User from the b2b portal else it should be NOT **visible**

[] Add the Query above into the Interceptor "Dealer Query (Australia)"

//ASSIGNMENT //

[] Assignment rule handling for the above record producer

- Assign after creation automatically to group: "MBAuP VIP & Fleet Group"

If the above group does not exist, create the group with:

 - Group members as mentioned in column 'Fulfiller functional department' in the attached spreadsheet

 - Group Manager as mentioned in column 'Escalation Logic/ Process' in the attached spreadsheet

 - Assign the Assignment Group to the CSM Domain 'omgt_au' (Order Management Australia)

 - Include the users also in the update set for deployment to further instances (This step is applicable only for the Fulfilment Groups) – as per discussion with Leonid and Pradeep on 27.01.2022

// PRIORITY / URGENCY/ SLA //

[] Data lookup rule:

Create new rule in x_4dai_omgt_mbos_dealer_query_overseas_lookup_rules

-Query type: the same as the query name

- Priority : 3-Moderate (due to [CR] INC INC0524720)

- Urgency: 2-Medium
