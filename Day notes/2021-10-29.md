## DFCT0011087 --> Working already - Done
I tested IMAC CityComp NewOrder with

RITM0423228

Dell Monitor 24" (CITYCOMP Service GmbH - 29216)

but the rest meassge was not send with error PEER NOT AUTHENTICATED.

When I tried the same using the REST Message IMAC Order CityComp >> newOrder everything worked fine.

Might be issue with auth
