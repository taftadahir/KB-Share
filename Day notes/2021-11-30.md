### Update set



Hi all,
So About the update set I have created on DEV instead of Proto instance. It may not be a Rome Upgrade issue. 

Basicaly, the issue was this:
Markus found that on PROTO instance, the MBMY dashboards was blank( they didn't have any reports on them ) and asked me to check and fix it. 
So I compare DEV and PROTO instance; I found that the dashboards's related tab(Dashboard Tabs)'s page was empty (I don't know why it does that because by default it create this page automatically when we add something to the dashboard), meaning that it does not store/links the reports ( we add to these dashboard ) to the dashboards => meaning again that the update set used when creating these dashboards did not also capture the content of these dashboards.

The remaining solution I thought about was to just make sure that I capture the fixes and this is what I have done.

So we may also need to check that on PROD or INT as it is the same update set used to move these dashboards(I think).
