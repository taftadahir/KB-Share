Hello Markus

SFSTRY0005493
For this story, there is a user criteria missing("Training Coordinator MB Vans"). Gowri investigate it but it is not created.

What to do next?
	Do I ask him to create it? If yes, what are the details of that user criteria?
	If no, do I update the state of that story to ready for testing or leave it as WIP?

In the backend view the variables requested for and requested by fields are populated with the current user logged in, that is triggered by catalog client scripts. those script should only run when the order is placed not in the background.
