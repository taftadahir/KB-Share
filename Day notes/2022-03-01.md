## Queries consolidation ( SFSTRY0006475 )

### Implementation
- *Product Management* > *Diplomat Orders*, *Vehicle Specifications / Pricing Check*, *Model Launch Timing Query*, *Product Feature Functionality*, *Feature / Variant Availability*
	- Category dupplicated 2 times but have the same items. So I propose to delete the second one and have only *Passenger Cars Sales* > *Product Management* 
	- All the 5 items contains almost the same kind of fields so it could be all combined in one item. I don't know if in business level, you could find a way to renam the query but from my part, I don't see how.
	- To differentiate between these items( if we combine them ),we can add a field for that purpose so we can hide/show field depending on the type of the query
	- Also, if we combine the items, then the category will have only item meaning that we can also think of moving the item up(*Passenger Cars Sales*) and removing this category *Product Management*  completely

- *Retail Sales* > *On Line Retail Bonus - New Vehicles*, *On Line sales card - Demo Vehicles*
	- Category dupplicated 2 times and one called *Retail Sales Support*
	- *Retail Sales Support* don't have any items so can be removed
	- *On Line sales card - Demo Vehicles* and *On Line Retail Bonus - New Vehicles* contains almost the same fields except for this field *Request for bonus?* that exist in *On Line Retail Bonus - New Vehicles* but not in *On Line sales card - Demo Vehicles*
		- Need to find a new name for the combination, new description
		- And if necessary add a new field to differenciate between these item to help hide/show the field *Request for bonus?* and differenciate on the backend
- Resume *Retail Sales* 
	- As my investigation goes, I find almost all items in this category having almost the same type of fields. 
	- We could create a big one item for Retail Sales ( e.g. Retail Sales Service )
		- Have all the fields and a new field used to differenciate between the items( e.g. service) containing differents values
		- If this is an option, then removing the the category is also thinkable and move the combined item on the top level ( *Passenger Cars Sales* )

- *STS / Process Support*
	- Category dupplicated 2 times. Propose to remove the one under *Retail Sales* as the item it contain already is in the other one
	- The items seems to have differents business need so technachly combinig is not an issue but I see that they have a big differnce in *UC*, so we may want to leave them as they are

	- *Vehicle Processing Center*
		- Category not dupplicated so problem on that level
		- The items all seems talking about vehicle and have similar fields with little difference.
			- e.g. *Vehicle Processing service* as the item name
			- add a new field to differenciate between the services

- *Pre Owned Vehicles (POV)*
	- Category not dupplicated so problem on that level
	- The items all seems talking about vehicle and have similar fields with little difference.
	- These items could also be combined but need further investigate on business side to know how rename the item/description; How to differenciate between what these items offer (From technical side, we can do it using a new field)
