- Issue, need a new opened case from a dealer ( required )
	- meaning we need a dealer to create a case first -> full atf
	- use an existing new oponed case, no guarrantie that such case exist. If we run this on an instance were a case corresponding to our need doesn't exist, the atf will fail
- If we use an existing case for the test, this could result in running the Atf on a real case opened by a dealer ( if on PROD instance )
- Also for the SLA, we need a case opened by a dealer, we already done this partially on the full test
- Solution proposition, Need also a case, we already done in full atf
