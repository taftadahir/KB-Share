Hi Markus
I have some questions related to the story SFSTSK0003233.
I have found that there are options coming from sn_customerservice_case(baseline you refer to) and also their dupplicate coming from others tables(x_4dai_omgt_em_order_case_eu, x_4dai_omgt_sa_order_case, csm_order_case, x_4dai_orders_tisa_order_tisa).

What I understand is to disable these(coming from sn_customerservice_case):
- Solved – Fixed by Support/Guidance provided
- Solved – Fixed by closing related Change Request
- Solved – Fixed by closing related Incident
- Solved – Fixed by closing related PRB
- Solved – Workaround provided based on open PRB
- Solved by Customer
- Inconclusive – Out of scope
- Inconclusive – Cannot reproduce
- Inconclusive – No workaround
- Duplicate Issue
- Voided/Canceled

And you said also to enable these(I assume coming from the same table)
- Case closed without success
- Case outside of our jurisdiction
- Case closed without success

But there are not options like these in sn_customerservice_case. In story Joanna created, she just create new one. I assume that I need to create new one.

Questions
1. About mapping, I don't really understand it all. 
	1. I know that we need to make sure that what we disable need to be mapped with what we enable. 
	2. From the table, there is nothing to do. 
	3. But from form views(view using x_4dai_omgt_mbos_case, x_4dai_omgt_mbos_my_case and x_4dai_omgt_mbos_za_case tables), there are much todos.
	4. The question here is, do I need to remove all options in these views(resolution_code field) and replace them with the 3 ones? 
		1. If yes, then what about already existing records that use values from old options?
		2. If not, I assume that we need to rename these options with new options name but we will end up having multiples options having the same name with differente value(not great in form ui form filtering, etc).
