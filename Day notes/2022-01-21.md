Hi Markus,

So in our ATF for AU, we need to retrieve the account value in order to submit the case,

And We have two ways of getting it and we want to know which one of them is the right way.

  

-   The first is way
    Go to **account_relationship** table,  
    filter by **to_company.primary_contact=** Dealer,  
    Get the **from_company** field from **account_relationship** which is the account value.
- The second way
	Go to *u_alice_access* table
	Filter by *acc_primary_contact=* Dealer and *^ata_u_table=x_4dai_omgt_mbos_au_case*
	Get the *accrel_to_company* field from *u_alice_access* which is the account value
