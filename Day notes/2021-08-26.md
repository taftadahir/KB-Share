Hi Jana
I had to take a course on **HR Fundamentals**. I don't register yet. I had to inform you because it take 2 days and for each day, the course from 9AM to 5PM. 

This is the course
- 06-SEP-2021 - 07-SEP-2021 : Now there is only one seat available so hopefully, it will stay available by the time you answer me.

So can I take these two days depending on the projects?
