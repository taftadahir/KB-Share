SLA Condition conflict


Hello Everyone

We need to have two(2) sla(Response and Resolution) on a case
- Response created after case creation with these detail ( Reaction Time - Medium Urgency ["sys_id" = 5f2470071bfe74143f96eb9f7b4bcb99 ] )
	- Start condition
		- "Assigned To" is Empty AND
		- "Urgency" is "2 - Medium" AND
		- "Active" is true
	- Stop Condition
		- "Assigned To" is not Empty OR
		- "State" is one of ["Resolved", "Closed"]
- Resolution created after the Response is closed meaning( Resolution Time - M-Urgency, M-Priority ["sys_id" = 32deb9cb1b36b4143f96eb9f7b4bcb5f ] )
	- Start condition
		- "Assigned To" is not Empty AND
		- "Priority" is "3 - Moderate" AND
		- "Active" is true
		- "Urgency" is "2 - Medium"

Dealer : David Pouliot ( USER ID = D9POULID )
Fulfiller : Sussan Curcio ( HARBSUZ )
Record Producer : Online stock availability

If we analyse these conditions, we see that they should be executed at the same time resulting in closing the Response SLA and creating Resolution SLA in the same case update(assign user to the case) operation. 

Issues:
The Resolution SLA is created but the Response SLA doesn't get completed when we assign a fulfiller to the case until the next case update or we click manually on Repair SLA.

Informations:
We can do the whole process( creating the case and assignment ) using an admin account or use the Dealer( Create the case ) and Fulfiller( Assigned To ).
