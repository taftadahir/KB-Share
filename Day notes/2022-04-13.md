Hi Pradeep
so here the story about the sla flow SFSTRY0006872 and here the US CSM_SFFEAT0002116_SFSTRY0006872_FlowAdaptationToBR_DTAFTAD_v1

This is the BR( Dealer Query Overseas SLA BR ) I created to act as the flow ( [Dealer Query Overseas SLA Flow](https://dev4digitalservices.mercedes-benz.com/sys_hub_flow.do?sys_id=baa301161bc27c103f96eb9f7b4bcbb6&sysparm_view=welcome_hub_flow&sysparm_record_target=sys_hub_flow&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=88&sysparm_record_list=type%3Dflow%5EORtype%3D%5EORDERBYDESCsys_updated_on) ). 
I also updated these [sla definitions](https://dev4digitalservices.mercedes-benz.com/contract_sla_list.do?sysparm_query=active%3Dtrue%5Esys_scope%3D861bc8e11b017c103f96eb9f7b4bcb97%5Ename!%3DReaction%20Time%20(VN)%5EORname%3DNULL%5Ename!%3DResolution%20Time%20(VN)%5EORname%3DNULL&sysparm_view=) to use the default workflow.

I'll leave the US in Progress state for any update needed. Otherwise just tell me when to close it if you finish with testing this.

Thanks



- Update atfs
	- Do I update all the atf in one US? which story do I consider?


Hi everyone

Flow to BR
The BR is ready for testing and the story is still in draft.
I also updated the sla definition to use the workflow.
Here the US CSM_SFFEAT0002116_SFSTRY0006872_FlowAdaptationToBR_DTAFTAD_v1.

ATFs issues on INT
CSM_SFFEAT0002116_SFSTRY0006421_ATFCreateCaseInsteadExisting_DTAFTAD_v1
We have some ATF that use existing case but don't find any case on INT. So we update them so they will create a case at the beginning so they use later.

We need these on Int in order to proceed with ATFs testing.
