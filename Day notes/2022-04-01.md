**Action 1**
Wait until sla task is breached

**Action 2**
Create a record in **sysevent** with these values
- table = task_sla
- Instance = task sla record
- name = x_4dai_omgt_mbos.sla.warning.breach

**Action 3**
If ( Case priority is high : Task sla record -> task -> priority is critical or Task sla record -> task -> priority is High ) 
	then escalate case to high severity
		escalate case subflow
else if (  Case priority is Medium : Task sla record -> task -> priority is Medium )
	then escalate case to medium severity
		escalate case subflow
else ( Case priority is Low: Task sla record -> task -> priority is Low )
	then escalate case to Lowseverity
		escalate case subflow



Can we do this in workflow?
	Can we call a subflow from a workflow? 
		- no but we can configure this subflow as a workflow to use as a subflow
			- Can we create a workflow doing what the escalation subflow is doing?
	Can we create a record in workflow? - Create event activity and run script
	Can we wait until condition in workflow? - yes


## escalation subflow
Can we get input in a workflow? yes
Can we return an output?
