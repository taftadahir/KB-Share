List of Defects on CSM Proto after Rome upgrade

Hello Taftadjani,

These are the reporting issues detected in Proto:

- [x] Reporting MY - MB
	- [x] (MB) Fulfiller VCHAN20 cannot access dashboard "MBMY - Fulfiller Management" or "MBMY - Fulfiller"
		- (no widgets are being shown on the dashboard)
	- [x] (MB) admin cannot access dashboard "MBMY - Fulfiller Management" or "MBMY - Fulfiller" via "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management" -> Reporting -> Fulfiller Dashboard (no widgets are being shown on the dashboard)
	- Found here : Dashboard tab page is empty. 
		- [x] So I unload and rework the dashboard and made sure the tab's page is not empty.
- [ ] Queries MY
	- [ ] (MB) MY Dealer User "D8bambro - Bernard Ambrose" cannot see Queries and categories as expected on B2B portal
		- Onlything I found is that D8bambro is removed from 'Alice-Requestors' group by the interface. *So it need to need setup*
		- When you go to the D8bambro profile, you'll see that he is in the 'Alice-Requestors' group. But when you go into the 'Alice-Requestors' group, you will not find D8bambro.

          

In this story you need to create a task
