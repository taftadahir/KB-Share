List of Defects on CSM Proto after Rome upgrade

          

Hello Taftadjani,

These are the reporting issues detected in Proto:

*Reporting MY - MB

[] (MB) Fulfiller VCHAN20 cannot access dashboard "MBMY - Fulfiller Management" or "MBMY - Fulfiller"

(no widgets are being shown on the dashboard)

[] (MB) admin cannot access dashboard "MBMY - Fulfiller Management" or "MBMY - Fulfiller" via "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management" -> Reporting -> Fulfiller Dashboard (no widgets are being shown on the dashboard)

I saw also a query issue, please double check this might have been fixed by Gowri in the meantime as he worked on testing and fixing MY queries:

*Queries MY

[]  (MB) MY Dealer User "D8bambro - Bernard Ambrose" cannot see Queries and categories as expected on B2B portal

          

In this story you need to create a task

SFSTRY0005726

To document what you fix on proto and later on manually again on Dev when it is on Rome release.

Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions
