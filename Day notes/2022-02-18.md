### Solution design
[] make sure that the Fulfiller assigned to the input Fulfiller Group of the target Catalog Item can make comments and request information from the Dealer Agent.

Create test 'OMGT_Overseas_Fulfiller_Resolution'
-> your test must contain the following configurations:
Input Dataset:
-	Catalog Item (Query type)
-	Fulfiller Group (of the Catalog Item)

Create test run datasets for the following (as part of the initial test setup):
Test Run Dataset #1:
- Catalog Item: General Query - Warranty
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Customer Services Warranty AU

Test Run Dataset #2:
- Catalog Item: Marketing asset approval
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Vans Customer Services

Test Run Dataset #3:
- Catalog Item: General Query - Trade Club
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Trade Club Group AU

Test Run Dataset #4:
- Catalog Item: Dealer Claims
- Fulfiller Group: MBSEA2 Sales Support Team

Test Run Dataset #5:
- Catalog Item: Vehicle Billing
- Fulfiller Group: MBSA Business Development Group

Test steps:
-	Impersonate a Fulfiller from input Fulfiller Group.
-	Check below Fulfiller actions:
-	can access the application menu Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management
-	can access the module Assigned to My Group (in the menu "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management")
-	can open a query of the input query type (state is New or Open)
-	can assign himself to the Case
-	can select Resolution Code and enter Resolution Notes and click 'Propose solution'
     o	Validate this by checking the state is 'Resolved' and assert text entered above is in 'Resolution Notes' and 'Resolution Code'  
-	Can select Resolution Code and enter Resolution Notes and click 'Close Case'
     o         To test this step, re-open the case resolved in previous step and use it
     o         Validate this step by checking the state is 'Closed' and assert text entered above is in 'Resolution Notes' and 'Resolution Code'
