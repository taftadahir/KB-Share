- [x] Updated variable set internal name to 'imac_varset_order_info'
- [x] Added a function("getFutureDate") in "IMACRequestHelper" client script to add "days" using "8-5 weekdays" schedule.
- [x] Created a catalog client script "Order Info VarSet Onload" to add 10 days if catalog item is not "New PC or Laptop". The catalog item is not yet created. When it will be, juste copy the sys_id in if condition

So I think we are in a good way. I still can't test my variable set but I think the complexity is now simplified after my research. 

I have created an onload catalog client script to set the "Delivery Date" to "Today +10 days" using a Schedule(Only minor issue I see here is that it start counting the days from today)(I test it from my Personal Developper Instance).

In the script, I use a condition to only set this value when "New PC or Laptop" is not the current one. Right now, this catalog is not created, so when it will be, we need to paste the sys_id in the condition.

For next, We also want to set the "Delivery Date" field differently in "New PC or Laptop" as it depend on other field. So when "New PC or Laptop" is created, we need an onchange catalog client script on that field to set "Delivery Date" field. 

So yeah, this is how I break it. Hope you don't hate long detailled text. smiley
