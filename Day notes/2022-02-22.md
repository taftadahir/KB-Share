### Solution design
Create test 'OMGT_Overseas_SLA'
-> your test must contain the following configurations:
Input Dataset:
1.	Catalog Item / Query Type
2.	Fulfiller Group
3.	Initial Response SLA
4.	Initial Resolution SLA

Create test run datasets for the following (as part of the initial test setup):
Test Run Dataset #1:
- Catalog Item: General Query - Warranty
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Customer Services Warranty AU
- Input Response SLA: 
- Input Resolution SLA:

Test Run Dataset #2:
- Catalog Item: Marketing asset approval
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Vans Customer Services
- Input Response SLA: 
- Input Resolution SLA:

Test Run Dataset #3:
- Catalog Item: General Query - Trade Club
- Fulfiller Group: MBAuP Trade Club Group AU
- Input Response SLA: 
- Input Resolution SLA:

Test Run Dataset #4:
- Catalog Item: Dealer Claims
- Fulfiller Group: MBSEA2 Sales Support Team
- Input Response SLA: 
- Input Resolution SLA:

Test Run Dataset #5:
- Catalog Item: Vehicle Billing
- Fulfiller Group: MBSA Business Development Group
- Input Response SLA: 
- Input Resolution SLA:

Test steps:
Impersonate a Fulfiller from input Fulfiller Group and test the below
	Fulfiller can access the application menu Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management
	Fulfiller can access the module Assigned to My Group (in the menu "Mercedes-Benz Dealer Query Management")
	Fulfiller can open a query of the input query type (state is New and Assigned To is empty and Opened By is not empty and Opened By does not contain Admin)
	SLA: Check if SLA record is existing with: 
     	SLA Definition = Input Response SLA
     	Target = 'Response'
     	 Stage = 'In Progress'
	Fulfiller can assign himself to the Case
     	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	SLA Definition = Input Response SLA
     	Target = 'Response'
     	 Stage = 'Completed'
A new SLA record is created with:
     	SLA Definition = Input Resolution SLA
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'In Progress'
	Fulfiller can 'Request Info' with comments
	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'Paused'
Impersonate Dealer populated in the field 'Opened by' and test below
	Open B2B portal and can provide requested information to the Fulfiller
	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'In Progress'
	Fulfiller can change the Priority of the query
	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'Completed' --- Canceled
A new SLA record is created with:
     	Priority = updated priority of query
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'In Progress'
	Fulfiller can 'Propose Solution' with resolution code and resolution notes
	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'Completed'
	Dealer Open B2B portal and can reject the solution provided
	SLA: Check if a new SLA is created:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'In Progress'
	Fulfiller can 'Propose Solution' with alternate resolution code and resolution notes
	SLA: Check if SLA from previous step is:
     	Target = 'Resolution'
     	 Stage = 'Completed'
	Dealer can accept the solution provided by the Fulfiller
	SLA: No change
